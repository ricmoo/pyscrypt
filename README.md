pyscrypt
========

A very simple, pure-Python implementation of the scrypt password-based key derivation function and scrypt file format libraries with no dependencies beyond standard Python libraries.



API

### scrypt PBKDF hash

The scrypt algorithm is a password-based key derivation function, which takes in several parameters to adjust the difficulty and returns a string of bytes. This is useful for transforming passwords into a target length, while at the same time increaing the cost of attempting to brute-froce guess a password.

* `password` - a passowrd
* `salt` - a cryptographic salt
* `N` - general work factor
* `r` - memory cost
* `p` - computation cost (parallelization factor)
* `dkLen` - the output length (in bytes) to return


```python
import pyscrypt

hashed = pyscrypt.hash(password = "correct horse battery staple", 
                       salt = "seasalt", 
                       N = 1024, 
                       r = 1, 
                       p = 1, 
                       dkLen = 256)
print(hashed.encode('hex'))
```

### Write a scrypt Encrypted File

When writing a file the `N`, `r` and `p` parameters are required. The `salt` parameter is optional, and if omitted will be generated from _urandom_.

The scrypt file format includes a final checksum in the file, so be sure to close the file to ensure the checksum is correctly flushed to disk. If the underlying file object cannot be closed (for example, StringIO will release its contents on close) then use the `finalize` method.

```python
import pyscrypt

fp = file('filename.scrypt', 'w')
f = pyscrypt.ScryptFile(fp, "password", N = 1024, r = 1, p = 1)
f.write("Hello World")
f.close()

# Instead of close, use this method to keep the underlying file open
#f.finalize()
```

### Read a scrypt Encrypted File

```python
import pyscrypt

# Read the entire contents
fp = file('filename.scrypt')
f = pyscrypt.ScryptFile(fp, password = "password")
print(f.read())

# Iterate over each line
fp = file('filename.scrypt')
f = pyscrypt.ScryptFile(fp, password = "password")
for line in f:
  print(line)

# Ensure the integrity of the file after completely read
print(f.valid)
```



Test Harness
------------

A handful of test cases are provided for both the hash algorithm and the ScryptFile library. The ScryptFile tests generate tests that can be validated against the command line utility (http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html).

```python
# python tests/run-tests-hash.py
Version: 1.3.1
Test 1: pass
Test 2: pass
Test 3: pass
Test 4: pass
Test 5: pass

# python tests/run-tests-file.py 
Version: 1.3.1
Test Encrypt/Decrypt: text_length=3 result=pass valid=True
Test Encrypt/Decrypt: text_length=16 result=pass valid=True
Test Encrypt/Decrypt: text_length=127 result=pass valid=True
Test Encrypt/Decrypt: text_length=128 result=pass valid=True
Test Encrypt/Decrypt: text_length=129 result=pass valid=True
Test Encrypt/Decrypt: text_length=1500 result=pass valid=True
Created /tmp/test-10.scrypt and /tmp/test-10.txt. Check with tarsnap.

Created /tmp/test-1000.scrypt and /tmp/test-1000.txt. Check with tarsnap.
Test Verify: filename=tests/test1.scrypt result=pass
Test Decrypt: dec('tests/test1.scrypt') == 'tests/test1.txt' result=pass valid=None
Test Decrypt: dec('tests/test1.scrypt') == 'tests/test1.txt' result=pass valid=True
Test Decrypt: dec('tests/test1.scrypt') == 'tests/test1.txt' result=pass valid=True
Test Verify: filename=tests/test2.scrypt result=pass
Test Decrypt: dec('tests/test2.scrypt') == 'tests/test2.txt' result=pass valid=None
Test Decrypt: dec('tests/test2.scrypt') == 'tests/test2.txt' result=pass valid=None
Test Decrypt: dec('tests/test2.scrypt') == 'tests/test2.txt' result=pass valid=True
```

Notice that `valid` is sometimes None. The value of `valid` can take on one of three values:
* **None** - File has not been entirely read, so the checksum cannot be verified
* **True** - The end-of-file checksum is valid
* **False** - The end-of-file checksum is invalid (some bytes in the file are corrupt)

Performance
-----------

The scrypt algorithm is a CPU and memory intense algorithm, **by design**. For comparison, here are numbers based on my MacBook Air for scrypt hashing with (N = 1024, r = 1, p =1):

**CPython** (what you probably have installed)

6 hashes per second

**Pypy** (a much faster Python implementation, see [pypy.org](http://pypy.org))

250 hashes per second

**C-Wrapper** (See the FAQ below)

2364 hashes per second


FAQ
---

**Why is this so slow?**
It is written in pure Python. It is not meant to be fast, more of a reference solution.


**How do I get one of these C wrappers you speak of?**

```python
> # Download the source
> curl -L https://github.com/forrestv/p2pool/archive/13.4.tar.gz > p2pool-13.4.tar.gz

> # Untar
> tar -xzf p2pool-13.4.tar.gz

> # Build and install
> cd p2pool-13.4/litecoin_scrypt/
> python setup.py build
> sudo python setup.py install

> python
>>> import scrypt
>>> scrypt.hash(password = "correct horse staple battery", 
                salt = "seasalt", 
                N = 1024, 
                p = 1, 
                r = 1, 
                buflen = 256)
```

**Can I give you my money?**
Umm... Ok? :-)
